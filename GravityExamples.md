# Getting Started #

This page discusses getting started with the Gravity software by using the examples provided in test/examples.  Before starting in with the code, make sure you've built all the binaries required to use the system.  See the [[GravitySetup]] page for info on doing that.

## Building and running the examples ##

Each of the examples can be built and run (not currently supported in Windows).  Here's a quick rundown of how to do that (again, this assumes you've gone through the steps in [[GravitySetup]]):
* open a terminal and cd to "<gravity root>/tests/examples/1 - BasicDataProduct"
* run the command "./run.sh"
* hit ctrl-c to kill the run
